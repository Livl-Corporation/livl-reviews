### **Conceptual diagram**

- The main entities are represented by the "User", "Agent" and "Reviewer" classes. "Agent" and "Reviewer" inherit from the "User" class, reflecting their inheritance relationship in the context of the system.

- The "Invitation" entity is used to represent invitations sent by agents and received by reviewers. The relationship between "Agent" and "Invitation" is a one-to-many relationship, as is the relationship between "Reviewer" and "Invitation".

- The "RequestState" enumeration represents the various possible states of a test request. This enumeration is associated with the "RequestEvent" class, which records the events associated with a test request.

- The "Review" and "Product" entities represent, respectively, the reviews written by testers and the products available for testing. There is a one-to-many relationship between "Product" and "Condition", where each product is associated with a specific test condition.

- Condition" and "Subcription" entities are also included in the diagram, representing respectively the test conditions for a product and the subscriptions of agents and testers.
